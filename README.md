# About Me
## Hi, I'm Meshari üëã

I'm a final-year Computer Science student. I have a strong interest in applying machine learning and software engineering to solve practical problems.

## üî≠ What I Built

- **DeepSeek-Instagram Automation Bot:** A complete Python system that integrates multiple APIs to automate social media workflows. Focused on clean architecture and thorough documentation.
- **Kaggle Deep Learning:** Completed practical courses in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, implementing projects from data cleaning to model deployment with XGBoost, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.

## üå± Current Focus

I am actively deepening my practical skills in core AI domains relevant to modern applications:

*   **Computer Vision with PyTorch:** Experimenting with image preprocessing, augmentation, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build a strong foundation in visual recognition tasks.
*   **Transformer Architectures:** Moving beyond using API models to studying the core "Attention is All You Need" paper and building basic transformer components to understand their inner workings.
*   **End-to-End Project Execution:** Focusing on the entire ML pipeline‚Äîfrom data collection and cleaning to model deployment‚Äîemphasizing clean code and thorough documentation.
